<h1>98 Lumens dashboard</h1>

Should augment the existing web presence of 98 Lumens. The main consumer-facing application that is intended to serve a couple of goals:

1. Create an emotional connection between the user and their offsite asset.
2. Allow that user to share data and the experience with others that may also be interested.

Current iteration is a v1 prototype that includes features such as a real-time energy gauge, solar output over a date range, and summary information with respect to lifetime output, financial gain, and environmental impact. 

The static_pages that are included are dated as they are forked from the main set.
